## 🚀 **PROJECT READY FOR NEXT PHASE!**

Testing infrastructure is **COMPLETE**. The project now needs:

### **🎮 IMMEDIATE PRIORITY: Make It Playable**
1. **Simple AI Opponent** (3-4 hours) - ⚠️ **CRITICAL BLOCKER**
   ```csharp
   public class SimpleAI {
       public string DecideAction(Character ai, List<Character> enemies);
       public string DecideDefense(Character ai, int incomingDamage);
   }
   ```

2. **Game Loop Enhancement** (30-60 mins)
   - "Play Again?" functionality  
   - Win/Loss screens with combat statistics
   - VS AI mode selection

3. **Save/Load System** (3-4 hours)
   - JSON serialization of game state
   - Auto-save every turn capability
   - Load saved games

4. **Configuration System** (2-3 hours)
   - balance.json for all game values
   - Hot-reload for testing different balance
