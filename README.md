A tactical turn-based RPG combat engine with dice-based mechanics, inspired by D&D combat systems. Features ASCII grid visualization, modular architecture, and comprehensive combat mechanics including the innovative "Badminton Streak" counter-attack system.

## 🎮 Features

### Current Implementation
- **Turn-Based Combat**: Strategic combat with action economy management
- **Dice-Based Mechanics**: 1d6/2d6 rolls for movement, attack, and defense
- **Grid Combat System**: 16x16 tactical grid with adjacency-based attack ranges
- **Advanced Movement**: Simple move (1d6 + MOV, allows second action) vs Dash (2d6 + MOV, ends turn)
- **Evasion System**: Dice-based evasion with tactical repositioning on successful dodges
- **Counter-Attack Mechanics**: "Badminton Streak" system - build counter gauge through over-defense
- **Resource Management**: Stamina-based action economy (ATK: 3, DEF: 2, MOV: 1, REST: 0)
- **Character Stats**: 6-stat system (STR, END, CHA, INT, AGI, WIS) with derived combat values
- **ASCII Visualization**: Clean dot-grid display with character positioning

### Combat Actions
| Action | Cost | Mechanics | Secondary Effects |
|--------|------|-----------|------------------|
| **Attack** | 3 Stamina | 2d6 + ATK modifier | Target must respond (DEF/MOV/TAKE) |
| **Defend** | 2 Stamina | 2d6 + DEF modifier | Builds counter gauge on over-defense |
| **Move** | 1 Stamina | 1d6 + MOV modifier | Allows second action |
| **Dash** | 1 Stamina | 2d6 + MOV modifier | Ends turn, greater distance |
| **Evasion** | 1 Stamina | 2d6 + MOV vs incoming attack | Can reposition on success |
| **Rest** | 0 Stamina | Restores 5 stamina | Access to special abilities |

├── Combat/             # Combat resolution and mechanics
├── Core/               # Game state, turns, and orchestration

└── Grid/               # Spatial positioning and movement
```

### Design Principles
- **Modular Architecture**: Each system is loosely coupled and independently testable
- **Unity-Ready**: Clean separation between game logic and presentation layer
- **Extensible**: Plugin architecture for new combat mechanics and character abilities
- **Deterministic**: Reproducible combat with optional seed-based randomization
- **Event-Driven**: Comprehensive logging and state change notifications

### Key Classes
- `GameManager`: Orchestrates game flow and state transitions
- `CombatSystem`: Handles attack/defense resolution and counter mechanics
- `TurnManager`: Manages turn order and action validation
- `MovementSystem`: Dice-based movement with tactical positioning
- `Character`: Entity system with stats, resources, and abilities

### Basic Gameplay
```
Commands:
  attack B              # Attack adjacent character
  move                  # Roll 1d6 movement, allows second action  
  dash 8 10            # Roll 2d6 movement to specific position
  rest                 # Recover stamina
  defend               # Take defensive stance
```
